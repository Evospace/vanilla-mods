Accessors1Description="Most blocks have inputs and/or outputs, called Accessors. Accessors are color-coded:\nyellow for <yellow>Kinetic</>, blue for <blue>Electricity</>, red for <red>Heat</>.\n\nThere is no specific marking on the blocks to indicate whether it's an input or output, but it's usually not hard to guess based on the block's functions. This is also directly mentioned in the item's description.\n\nDuring the construction of blocks, you can see the Accessors as shown in the image above. To transfer energy from one block to another, it's necessary to arrange them so that Accessors of the same type connect. Also, there are specific conduits for each type of Accessor: Cables for electricity, Heat Pipes for heat, and Flywheels for kinetic energy."
