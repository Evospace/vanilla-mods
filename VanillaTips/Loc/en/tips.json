This is also directly mentioned in the item's description.\n\nDuring the construction of blocks, you can see the Accessors as shown in the image above. To transfer energy from one block to another, it's necessary to arrange them so that Accessors of the same type connect. Also, there are specific conduits for each type of Accessor: Cables for electricity, Heat Pipes for heat, and Flywheels for kinetic energy."
